    " 1) What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "a)Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, exceptions and automatic\n",
    "memory management. The benefits of pythons are that it is simple and easy, portable,\n",

    "retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.\n",
    "4) How Python is interpreted?\n",
    "A)Python language is an interpreted language. Python program runs directly from the source\n",
    "code. It converts the source code that is written by the programmer into an intermediate\n",
    "language, which is again translated into machine language that has to be executed.\n",
